## Features

### Smilar with Data Jpa

Implemented functions similar to Spring Data Jpa, such as method definition query, association query, etc.

### More Flexible

Although the JPA specification is implemented, it is actually more flexible and more suitable for business development

### Base on Mybatis

Of course, I didn't implement an ORM framework from zero, just enhanced on Mybatis, so you can use the syntax of Mybatis completely

### Code Generator

Provides a code generator for faster development

## How to use with Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alilitech</groupId>
    <artifactId>mybatis-jpa</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
